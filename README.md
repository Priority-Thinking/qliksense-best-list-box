# Qlik Sense Best List Box

We created this list box extension because we found the list boxes that come with Qlik Sense are bland and featureless and other list box extensions out there do not improve the look and feel of the listboxes. Hopefully this project will both look good and have a bunch of useful features!

## Getting Started

This project contains only three files. Open your Qlik Sense deployment's dev-hub ([qlik-sense-domain]/dev-hub/) and create a new visualization. Name it "best-list-box" and use the Listbox template. Then, copy the contents of the "best-list-box.qext" file in this project into the file that was generated with the new extension. Click "New File" (plus sign) on the right side of the dev-hub and name it "best-list-box.js" and another named "style.css". Copy the contents of their respective files in this project into the dev-hub. Now, when you are editing a sheet, you will see the "best-list-box" extension is available under Custom Objects and Extensions.
